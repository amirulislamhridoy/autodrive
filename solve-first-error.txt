This can be fixed by removing the lockfile and regenerating it with a newer version of your package manager npm i -g npm@latest.
If SWC continues to fail to load you can opt-out by disabling swcMinify in your next.config.js or by adding a .babelrc to your project with the following content:
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"]
}
